TODO (Bugs)
- move away from naually copying .dll files to build directory
- fix flickering 3d Viewer
- apply a stylesheet
- calculate raw material with user specified facing allowance
- update documentation to include all changes 
- correctly apply the transformations of the generated toolpath to be synced with the parts transformation along the z axis
- change the initial viewer orientation to correspond to the standard lathe orientation
- select part orientation axis from 3d view is not working correctly. If the slection mode is enabled and something thats not a valid geometry is clicked, it should exit selection mode


-* Tool Name in tool library not linked to name parameter in tool editor dialog
-* Tool Manager should be moved up one tab view to where its next to the machine tab not inside of the machine tab. 
- Tool 3d preview in dialog should replace the view controls with a view cube and the standard mouse controls
- if a tool is generated without a name, it cannot be deleted. Ensure a tool is only saved once a name is entered
-* the recommended tool lists in all operation tabs should be linked to the actual tool list of the application thats maintained by the tool manager
- adding an insert or holder iso code should automatically extraxt all information encoded in it and update the parameters. Changing a generated parameter automatically removes the iso code from the text box
- Toolpath generation pipeline should take actual tools into account
- In addition to the generated toolpaths, the extracted 2d profile should also be dispalyed in the viewer and be managed by the visibility menu
