TODO (Bugs)
- move away from naually copying .dll files to build directory
- fix flickering 3d Viewer
- apply a stylesheet
- calculate raw material with user specified facing allowance
- update documentation to include all changes 
- correctly apply the transformations of the generated toolpath to be synced with the parts transformation along the z axis
- change the initial viewer orientation to correspond to the standard lathe orientation
- select part orientation axis from 3d view is not working correctly. If the slection mode is enabled and something thats not a valid geometry is clicked, it should exit selection mode
- switch the current chuck, loaded as a step file to a proper occt chuck implementation, allowing the jaws to adapt to the current raw material diameter


-* Tool Name in tool library not linked to name parameter in tool editor dialog
-* Tool Manager should be moved up one tab view to where its next to the machine tab not inside of the machine tab. 
- Tool 3d preview in dialog should replace the view controls with a view cube and the standard mouse controls
- if a tool is generated without a name, it cannot be deleted. Ensure a tool is only saved once a name is entered
-* the recommended tool lists in all operation tabs should be linked to the actual tool list of the application thats maintained by the tool manager
- adding an insert or holder iso code should automatically extraxt all information encoded in it and update the parameters. Changing a generated parameter automatically removes the iso code from the text box
- Toolpath generation pipeline should take actual tool parameters into account
- In addition to the generated toolpaths, the extracted 2d profile should also be dispalyed in the viewer and be managed by the visibility menu



* Edit **default tool set** that is auto-loaded on first database init and can always be restored.

  * Right-hand tool: internal metric threading
  * Right-hand tool: internal boring
  * Right-hand tool: parting / grooving
  * Right-hand tool: external metric threading
  * Left-hand tool: longitudinal turning
  * Right-hand tool: longitudinal turning / facing / chamfering
  * Right-hand tool: longitudinal turning
  * Right-hand tool: facing / chamfering
  * Neutral tool: longitudinal turning

* Add **empirically derived cutting data** for each default tool for: Brass, Steel, Aluminum, Delrin, Cast Iron.

  * Sync these materials with the global material list in the Setup tab.
  * Only show a tool in “Available Tools” if it has data for the currently selected material.

* **Cutting Data UI logic**

  * If “Constant Surface Speed” = ON → hide *Spindle RPM*, show *Surface Speed*.
  * If “Constant Surface Speed” = OFF → hide *Surface Speed*, show *Spindle RPM*.

* **Feed Control UI logic**

  * If “Feed per Revolution” = ON → show FeedRate, Lead-In, Lead-Out in *mm/rev*.
  * If OFF → show them in *mm/min*.

* ~~**Move capabilities** from Toolholder tab to Tool Information tab; capabilities apply to the whole tool (holder + insert).~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**

  * ~~Checkboxes: Internal Threading, Internal Boring, Parting/Grooving, External Threading, Longitudinal Turning, Facing, Chamfering.~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**

* **Reorder tabs** in the Edit-Tool dialog so that *Tool Information* is the left-most tab.

* **Remove Tool Offset settings** (not needed now).
