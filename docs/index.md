# IntuiCAM Documentation

Welcome to the IntuiCAM documentation. IntuiCAM is an open-source, cross-platform CAM application for CNC turning. It combines a high-performance C++ core engine with an intuitive Qt-based GUI to streamline toolpath generation and G-Code export for lathe operations.

Whether you’re a user looking to generate your first turning job or a developer aiming to extend IntuiCAM, you’ll find everything here:
