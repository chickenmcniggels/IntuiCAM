# Getting Started with IntuiCAM

Welcome to IntuiCAM! This guide will help you get started with the application after installation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have successfully built IntuiCAM following the [Installation Guide](installation.md) or [Windows Setup Guide](windows_setup.md).

## Launching IntuiCAM

### GUI Application

Launch the Qt-based graphical interface:

**Windows:**
```powershell
cd build
.\Release\IntuiCAMGui.exe
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
cd build
./bin/IntuiCAMGui
```

```

## First Steps

ðŸš§ **Note**: IntuiCAM is currently in active development. The user interface and workflows are being implemented.

When you load a STEP file, IntuiCAM automatically creates four machining stepsâ€”Contouring, Threading, Chamfering and Parting. These appear in the toolpath timeline at the bottom of the window, where you can enable or disable each step.

### Current Status

- âœ… **Build System**: Complete and verified
- âœ… **Core Libraries**: Architecture established
- âœ… **Dependencies**: Qt, OpenCASCADE, VTK integrated
- ðŸ”„ **GUI Implementation**: In progress
- ðŸ”„ **CAM Algorithms**: In development
- ðŸ”„ **STEP Import**: Planned
- ðŸ”„ **Toolpath Generation**: Planned
- ðŸ”„ **G-Code Export**: Planned

### Development Roadmap

1. **Phase 1** (Current): Build system and dependencies
2. **Phase 2**: Basic GUI and file import/export
3. **Phase 3**: Core CAM algorithms (turning operations)
4. **Phase 4**: Toolpath visualization
5. **Phase 5**: G-Code generation and post-processing
