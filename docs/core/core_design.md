# Details regarding the CAM-Core-Engine
## Turning Toolpath Generation
**The following turning toolpaths are proposed:**
* Outside roughing
* Outside finishing
* Inside roughing
* Inside finishing
* Drilling
* Facing
* Parting
* Threading
* Outside grooving
* Inside grooving
* Chamfering
* (Trepaning - Grooving on the face of the part)
* (Adaptive Roughing)

All turning need to support cam-side cutter radius compensation. This can also be done on the machine-side therefore it must be toggleable.

## Milling Toolpath Generation
**The following milling toolpaths are proposed:**
* Basic Linear Roughing
* Adaptive Roughing
* Contouring
* Drilling
* Chamfer Milling
* Radius Milling
* (Thread Milling)
