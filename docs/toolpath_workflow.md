# Toolpath Workflow

When a part is loaded, IntuiCAM creates four default machining steps:

1. **Contouring**
2. **Threading**
3. **Chamfering**
4. **Parting**

These steps are shown as a timeline in the GUI. Each step can be enabled or disabled and configured before toolpaths are generated. Additional operations will be added in the future, but the default workflow provides a quick path from model import to simulation and G-code export.
