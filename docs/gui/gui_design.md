# GUI Overview

## Step Viewer and Workflow
The GUI focuses on a streamlined turning workflow. When you load a part, the **Part Setup** tab is displayed. The bottom portion contains a timeline of four machining steps:

1. **Contouring**
2. **Threading**
3. **Chamfering**
4. **Parting**

These steps are automatically generated in this order. Each step can be toggled on or off and expanded to adjust parameters. The order in the timeline reflects the machining sequence.

## Simulation
A built-in simulation with collision detection runs after toolpaths are generated, similar to the preview in 3D printing slicers.

## Tools
A default set of turning tools is provided, but users can add custom tools via a wizard that accepts standard ISO codes and converts them to geometry.
